<h1>Origins</h1>
<p>In 1971, five high school students in San Rafael, California,[5][6] used the term "4:20" in connection with a plan to
    search for an abandoned cannabis crop, based on a treasure map made by the grower.[7][8] Calling themselves the
    Waldos,[9][10] because their typical hang-out spot "was a wall outside the school",[11] the five students—Steve Capper,
    Dave Reddix, Jeffrey Noel, Larry Schwartz, and Mark Gravich[12]—designated the Louis Pasteur statue[13] on the grounds
    of San Rafael High School as their meeting place, and 4:20 pm as their meeting time.[11] The Waldos referred to this
    plan with the phrase "4:20 Louis". After several failed attempts to find the crop, the group eventually shortened their
    phrase to "4:20", which ultimately evolved into a code-word the teens used to refer to consuming cannabis.[7]

    Steven Hager of High Times popularized the story of the Waldos.[14] The first High Times mention of 4:20 smoking and a
    4/20 holiday appeared in May 1991,[15] and the connection to the Waldos appeared in December 1998. Hager attributed the
    early spread of the phrase to Grateful Dead followers[16]—after "Waldo" Reddix became a roadie for the Grateful Dead's
    bassist, Phil Lesh[12]—and called for 4:20 pm to be the socially accepted time of the day to consume cannabis</p>
